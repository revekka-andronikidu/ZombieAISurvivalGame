# Zombie Survival Game

## Description
Welcome to the Zombie Survival AI Agent project! In this repository, you'll find the code for an AI agent designed to navigate and survive in a challenging zombie-infested world. This project was a part of my Gameplay Programming course.

The agent has limited information about its surroundings. It has a rough knowledge about the world in general and the entities within its line of sight. The goal of the agent is to survive for as long as possible, aiming for a high score. o achieve this, the agent needs to actively gather and use helpful items scattered throughout the world and use them to handle the threat of the roaming enemy zombies.
