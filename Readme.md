# Zombie Survival Game

## Description
Welcome to the Zombie Survival AI Agent project! In this repository, you'll find the code for an AI agent designed to navigate and survive in a challenging zombie-infested world. This project was a part of my Gameplay Programming course.

The agent has limited information about its surroundings. It has a rough knowledge about the world in general and the entities within its line of sight. The goal of the agent is to survive for as long as possible, aiming for a high score. o achieve this, the agent needs to actively gather and use helpful items scattered throughout the world and use them to handle the threat of the roaming enemy zombies.

## Implementation
###Decision making
I chose behavior tree for my decision making in the AI Zombie survival game because of its versatility and ease of implementation. Behavior trees provide a hierarchical structure that allows me to break down complex decision-making processes into manageable and modular components. In the context of a zombie survival game, where the agent needs to navigate a dynamic and unpredictable environment, behavior trees offer a clear and intuitive way to represent the logic behind the AI's actions.

The adaptability of behavior trees makes them well-suited for scenarios where the AI must respond to various changing conditions. In the zombie survival game, the agent's decision-making process involves a range of tasks, such as searching for resources, avoiding and destroying zombies. By organizing these tasks into a behavior tree, I can easily adjust and extend the AI's behavior without rewriting the entire decision-making system.

Furthermore, behavior trees excel in handling priorities and decision sequences, allowing the AI to make informed choices based on the current game state. This hierarchical structure enables me to create a logical flow of actions for the AI, ensuring that it responds appropriately to different situations in the game. Ultimately, the decision to implement behavior trees aligns with the need for a scalable, adaptable, and efficient AI system in the context of a challenging and dynamic zombie survival environment.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Zombie Survival Game project demonstrates the successful implementation of behavior trees as the backbone of the decision-making proces, the agent's ability to navigate, survive, and strategically handle encounters with zombies showcases the power and flexibility of this structure.
